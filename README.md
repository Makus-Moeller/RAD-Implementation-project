# Randomized Algorithms 
## Implementation project

In this directory we present different algorithms to analyze a big stream of data. In the first part (task 1) we implement an algortihm to decide the precise squaresum of the stream,
using a hashtbale with chaining. We implement two versions, the multiply-shift and multiply-mod-prime hashing, and compare the runtime of the algorithms.

In the second part we implement the count-sketch algortihm, an approximative metod, to analyze the squaresum of same stream. We will see how time and precission develops with different parameters.   

To execute the code, clone the repo and enter dotnet run in your command line.
